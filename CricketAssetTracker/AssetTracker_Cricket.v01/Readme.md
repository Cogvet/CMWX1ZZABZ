More or less complete sketch demonstrating major portions of the asset tracker functionality. Still to add is fix frequency as a function of state of motion and implementation of the low power modes. Initial test of casting location data to TTN went well but the range from a moving car to the gateway was only a few km. More precise testing of range to follow.
