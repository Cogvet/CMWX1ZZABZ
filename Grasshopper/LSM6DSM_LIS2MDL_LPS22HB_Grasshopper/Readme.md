Demonstration of Grasshoper use on a breadboard and running an [all-ST sensor breakout](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/all-st-motion-sensor-breakout-board/) with the LSM6DSM accel/gyro, LIS2MDL magnetometer, and LPS22HB pressure/temperature sensor. The STM32L082 at 32 MHz runs the open-source Madgwick sensor fusing at 680 Hz, which is quite sufficient for ~2 degree heading accuracy with this fine sensor suite after proper calibration.
